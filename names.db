# Note:
# DNS response can have multiple records
# Every record must fit in 256 bytes, if not it will be splitted into chunks of 256 bytes
# a total DNS response must fit 65535 (UDP Datagram limit), 
# therefore MAX_SIZE of any TXT record is limited to ~65,200 bytes
#
# empty configuration will result in empty but valid responses
#
# P.S. unicode domain names are not supported but still can be catched by the server.
# for example мама-сервер-unicode.google.com will be catched but with SERVFAIL response
#
# Parsed values: hostname, type, record
# TTL response always 0
# 
# Macro templates: {{template}}
# file --> response with file content: {{file::/etc/passwd}}
# shellexec --> response with system command output: {{shellexec::dig google.com +short}}
# eval (python) --> response with custom python payload: {{eval::import random; res = '1.1.1.%d' % random.randint(1,255)}}
# resolve --> alias of {{resolve::self}}
# resolve::self --> behaves like dns forwarder (but only with one IP per domain)
# resolve::google.com --> response with IP of specified domain
# --- resolve macro currently supports A queries only, so if you specify TXT or another type it will resolve A type instead ---

# examples:

#passwd.example.com	TXT     {{file::/etc/passwd}}  # comments are ignored
#shellexec		TXT     {{shellexec::whoami}}
#eval			TXT     {{eval::import random; res = '1.1.1.%d' % random.randint(1,255)}}
#resolve1		A       {{resolve}}
#resolve2		A       {{resolve::self}}      # same as above
#resolve3		A       {{resolve::example.com}}
#blah.com		A       5.5.5.5
